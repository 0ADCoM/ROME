0 A.D. Mod Deddicated to Rome


A mod based around the civilization Rome and in honor of Rome.

Utilizing the pyrogenesis engine of 0 A.D. this mod is orintated as a realism and simulation for the game. 
Whilst being content with what the 0 A.D. dev has made thus far, theres no need to improve upon, but only 
to add vast amounts of extras such as building, new units, and indeed a new gameplay feature which will center around 
a Senate in the game.
