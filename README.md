ROME
====

0 A.D. Mod dedicated to Rome, targeting especially the Roman Republic.


A mod based around the civilization Rome and in honor of Rome.

Utilizing the pyrogenesis engine of 0 A.D. this mod is orintated as a realism and simulation for the game. 
Whilst being content with what the 0 A.D. team has made thus far, there's no need to reinvent their work, but only 
to add vast amounts of extras such as building, new units, and indeed a whole lot of new gameplay features which will center around a Senate in the game. 

To bring the senate to live we have started to developt a hybrid AI (artificial intelligence) that lives along with a human player.

The Senate
----
This new AI implies the introduction of at least the following features:
 
+ Citizens are aware of their leadership and have a loyality.
+ Citizens (at least the elite) have a sympathy towards each other (that e.g. decides which side a general may take in a inner conflict/civil war).
+ Citizens have a sympathy towards other civilizations as a whole. Hence not to individual citizens of other cultures. (this covers triumph marches)

+ Subduing other civilizations.

+ Rebellions (depending on loyalty and strength).

+ Capturing of units & buildings.

+ A RPG-like note as you might have to start as an infantry soldier, might become a centurio only to some day be one of two consul or even the overall dictator in wartime. Perhaps then - as a dictator - you might decide to overthrow the senate and take effective control by breaking the imperial law .. surrecting the Roman Empire. But beware, the senate is made up from many veteran generals and some might still have loyal troops additionally to their personal field tent guards (the praetorian).

+ Decentralised AI with many personalities and also surrecting defensive structures. [purely additive] 

+ An AI can split and join other AIs with its civilization within one CPU.

+ Reworked battle system/'physics' (we want nothing less than pure realism and will therefore read, study, test and not restraint from changing how the engine works in this feature). [this will be separated from the additive features]

+ Another feature where it'll be difficult to keep compatibility will be to make goods such as resources and props real objects, allowing units to drop their sword and e.g. archers to collect shot arrows from the battlefields. [this will be separated from the additive features]

+ ... many more like weather, day & night, splitting away of unhappy units from their original civilization. Effectively founding mini-civilizations that are very vulnerable to being subdued but also could be used as mercenary supply.


Goals:
* Those changes though severe must be compatible with the current mainstream 0AD simulation. => Keep it additive by extensions of existing classes instead of changing them. (restraint from refactoring, simply ~don't~~ use if you don't like how it's done in the trunk simulation version).
* Split new features into as much as is possible individual parts. (may be restructured and split at a later point.)

Created by history enthusiasts that stride towards the recreation of the ancient worlds that had much more civilised facets than one might like to think at first sight.
